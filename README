NVME TEST DRIVER
================

This is a project i started in university. I wanted to write a driver 
interacting with nvme-devices over pcie so i would be able to test them.

The idea is to create an interface over debug- and sys-fs and starting
tests on an nvme-device from there. The base for this project is the 
linux kernel provided under the GNU general public license 2.0 as described 
on https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/license-rules.html.


Linux kernel
============

There are several guides for kernel developers and users. These guides can
be rendered in a number of formats, like HTML and PDF. Please read
Documentation/admin-guide/README.rst first.

In order to build the documentation, use ``make htmldocs`` or
``make pdfdocs``.  The formatted documentation can also be read online at:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/

There are various text files in the Documentation/ subdirectory,
several of them using the reStructuredText markup notation.

Please read the Documentation/process/changes.rst file, as it contains the
requirements for building and running the kernel, and information about
the problems which may result by upgrading your kernel.
